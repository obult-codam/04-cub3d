# Raycasting Engine
This is a C project that implements a raycasting engine to render 3D graphics on a 2D screen. 
The engine supports custom wall textures of any size, as well as different maps and configurable settings for the ceiling, floor, and map colors.

# How to Use
To use this raycasting engine, you will need to clone or download this repository to your local machine. 
Then, you can compile and run the project using the Makefile provided.

By default, the engine will load the map file maps/working.cup, which is included in the repository.
This map file specifies the layout of the game world using ASCII characters.
Walls are represented by '1' characters and empty spaces are represented by '0' characters.
